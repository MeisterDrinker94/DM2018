To run DiSH on a sample data set, execute dish.py using Python 3.

We used the following packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib

dish.py contains all code related to the implementation of DiSH.

We tested our algorithm on two data sets:
 - The synthetic data set synthetic.csv is created by SyntheticData.py
 - The wages data set from http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/CPS_85_Wages
